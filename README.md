# Backend-Shopify

This is an inventory tracking web application possessing basic CRUD functionality, along with the ability to allow deletion comments and undeletion.

## 🔧 Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository using the command line:

```bash
git clone git@git.generalassemb.ly:tylergump150/Backend-Shopify.git
```


Then navigate to the app and install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm init -y
npm i express mongoose dotenv ejs method-override
```
(Note: you're welcome to create your own .env file and environmental variables but they're not required with this app)


Then simply start the app using the CLI (```nodemon``` || ``` node server.js```) and type "http://localhost:3000/inv" into your address bar, and you're good to go.
(Another note: make sure ```"main":``` is set to ```"server.js"``` in your package.json)
